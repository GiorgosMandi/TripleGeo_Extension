<h2>TripleGeo_Extension</h2>

**Wrapper** (Currently) is a module outside of TripleGeo that downloads the datasets of the
 requested areas, from geofabrik, and forwards them to TripleGeo. 

**_Ini_Constuctor_**  constructs the geofabrik_areas.ini file. It is called by Wrapper when
 the geofabrik_areas.ini doesn't exist.
